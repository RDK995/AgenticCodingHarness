# Harness Implementation Progress

## Current

Milestone: none active. All 24 milestones are `DONE`.
Open: B20 part 3 (recording tasks planned vs delegated) — partly covered by §47's
per-task tier record. See `.harness-dev/archive/B24.md` §Follow-ups.

## Reading this file

This file holds the `Current` pointer, the milestone index above, and the active
milestone only. It does not grow as milestones complete.

Completed milestone detail — tasks, acceptance criteria, evidence, validation,
decisions, follow-ups, blockers — lives in `.harness-dev/archive/`, one file per
milestone (`B1.md` … `B24.md`, plus `post-B11-retry-escalate.md`), verbatim as it
was recorded.

Read an archive file only when you need that milestone's evidence — to check what
was actually proven, or because the current milestone changes something an earlier
one verified. Never read the archive to answer "what is next"; the sections above
answer that. Never load the whole archive.

When a milestone reaches `DONE`, its section moves to
`.harness-dev/archive/B<n>.md` unchanged. No milestone is active, so this file
holds the pointer and the index only.
