# Planning a milestone

Read this on an **implementation phase**, before you break anything into tasks.
A fix cycle never needs it: the milestones exist by then, and the one in front of
it has already been picked up and sized.

Reconnaissance and the size/shape check run every implementation phase.
"Generating milestones" runs once per project — only when
`.harness/milestones.md` does not exist yet.

## Repository reconnaissance

Before generating milestones (and again, lightly, before planning tasks for a
milestone), do a lightweight inspection — don't spawn another agent for this,
and don't produce a large recon document. Determine only:

```
Architecture
Relevant files/modules
Existing conventions
Test framework
Build commands
Lint/type-check commands
Likely integration points
Material risks
```

This exists to make milestone/task planning better, not to be an artifact in
itself. Milestones must account for existing architecture, existing testing
patterns, existing public interfaces, and relevant integration boundaries.

## Generating milestones

If `.harness/requirements.md` exists and `.harness/milestones.md` does not,
generate milestones into it using **exactly** the structure in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/implement/references/milestones-template.md` — same headings
(`### Outcome`, not a renamed or added heading), same order, nothing extra.
Reconnaissance is a planning input, not persisted state: use it to shape the
milestones, but do not write a reconnaissance section into `milestones.md`
itself. The file holds milestones only.

Milestones represent **observable outcomes**, not implementation steps. Tests
belong inside each milestone, not as a separate milestone.

### Slice thin, end to end

A milestone is a **thin vertical slice**: the narrowest behaviour that runs
through the whole system, not one layer of it built out. The first slice is a
walking skeleton — the thinnest path that works end to end — and later slices
deepen it.

Every milestone must carry at least one acceptance criterion **exercised through
a real entry point**: a CLI invocation, an HTTP request, a public API call. If the
only way to demonstrate a milestone is a unit test of an internal component, it is
a component milestone and must be re-cut.

Order slices by integration risk, not by convenience. The first one should prove
the part most likely to be wrong, because that is the evidence worth having early.
A layered plan defers every integration risk to the end, where it costs the most
to act on.

**Thin is not a shortcut through the architecture.** The pressure a slice creates
is to bypass a boundary — to write persistence inline in the CLI because that is
the fastest route to something working. Do not. A slice crosses every boundary the
architecture defines; it crosses each one shallowly. A component may be a stub in
an early slice, but the seam is real from the first slice onwards, and dissolving
one silently is the defect this harness treats most seriously (see Architecture
in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/orchestrator.md`).

When `.harness/architecture.md` exists, each milestone's `### Architecture` field
lists the component ids that slice **advances**. A slice normally advances several
components a little rather than completing any one, and a component is legitimately
built across several slices — partial, or stubbed behind a real seam, in the early
ones.

Before finishing generation, check the coverage gate: **every component must be
exercised by at least one milestone.** A component nothing exercises is either a
planning gap or a component that should not be in the architecture — resolve it
rather than leaving it unbuilt. The gate is about coverage, not about one
milestone per component; mapping them one-to-one produces a layered plan.

Milestones describe outcomes, not components: `M1 — Accounts can be created`, not
`M1 — Build C1`.

With no architecture file, write `N/A` in that field.

Good — each runs end to end and is demonstrable through the API:
```
M1 — An account can be created through the API and survives a restart
M2 — Duplicate emails are rejected with a clear error
M3 — Accounts can be listed and paged
```

Bad — layers. Nothing is demonstrable until the last one:
```
M1 — User domain model supports account creation
M2 — User creation API is exposed
M3 — User creation is integrated with persistence
```

Bad — implementation steps:
```
M1 — Create files
M2 — Add classes
M3 — Write functions
M4 — Write tests
```

### How big is a milestone

Size a milestone by its **acceptance criteria**: target **3-5**, and past **7**
it is two milestones. Decide that here, during generation — a milestone that is
too large is not discovered until it has already cost a long context to run.

Criteria are the measure because they are fixed here, visible in
`milestones.md` afterwards, and checkable by a human without watching the run.
Each one needs an implementation, a test, and recorded evidence, so ten criteria
is not a large milestone — it is two or three milestones that were written as
one.

Split on the outcome, not the checklist: two milestones each of which is
independently implementable, testable and reviewable, not one outcome with its
criteria dealt out between them. If a split leaves a half that cannot be reviewed
on its own, the seam is in the wrong place.

Milestones should still be meaningful outcomes rather than microtasks — but
"a small number of milestones" is not itself a goal, and buying fewer milestones
by making each one larger costs far more than it saves.
